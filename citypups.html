          <p>This was a one week, modified Google Ventures design sprint where I, as a one person team, completed a design challenge for CityPups.</p>

          <h1>The Problem</h1>
          <p>People who live in cities want to be able to find a dog to adopt that fits their specific lifestyles in terms of living environment and daily routines. Some common frustrations noted from the research were that there was <strong>not enough logistical information</strong> about the dogs, for example, how much attention, space, and exercise they need, and oftentimes there is a <strong>lack of consistent information</strong> on how to contact the animal shelters. Overall, the descriptions on each dog’s profile on adoption sites are too general and aren’t helpful in helping people find the perfect dog for them to adopt.</p>

          <h4>User Research Notes</h4>
          <p><strong>Q: What do you consider when looking for a dog to adopt?</strong></p>
          <p><strong>A: </strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pictures of the dog are the first things that grab attention</li>
            <li>How much indoor space needed</li>
            <li>Basic info (size, age, breed)</li>
            <li>Pictures and dog bios help give a good sense of the dog’s personality</li>
            <li>How much attention needed</li>
            <li>How dog behaves in a busy city with lots of people and other dogs (not just in the household)</li>
            <li>How well-trained/well-behaved the dog is</li>
            <li>Animal shelter info + how far away it is and if it’s easily accessible by public transportation or by foot if user does not have car</li>

          </ul>

          <p><strong>Persona: </strong> Elli, 27yo, lives alone in a studio in New York City</p>
          <p><strong>Frustrations: </strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Current adoption sites don’t have enough logistical info (how much space, attention, activity needed)</li>
            <li>Dog descriptions on sites too general; hard to gauge dog’s personality</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Goals: </strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Find dog to adopt and be confident that the dog is a great fit (emotional connection + practical lifestyle factors)</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>User Flow</h4>
          <p>I created a user flow that outlined from beginning to end how a user might navigate from the homepage of CityPups to deciding on the perfect dog to adopt.</p>

          <h1>Day 2: Brainstorm Solutions</h1>
          <h4>Crazy 8's Brainstorm</h4>
          <div id="crazy8">
            <img src="assets/img/citypups_brainstorm.jpg" width="700">
          </div>
          <p>
            On the second day of the design sprint, I spent about 8 minutes doing an activity
            called "Crazy 8's", where I came up with <strong>eight unique sketches of the critical screen</strong>.
            I determined the critical screen of CityPups to be the profile of an individual dog
            that is up for adoption because the dog's profile is ultimately what convinces the user
            whether or not that dog is the perfect dog for them or not.
          </p>
          <h4>Solution Sketch</h4>
          <div id="solsketch">
            <img src="assets/img/citypups_solutionsketch.jpg" width="700">
          </div>
          <p>
            After making some mental critiques on each sketch from the Crazy 8's activity,
            I chose a design to move forward with that addressed the frustrations and goals
            mentioned in the user research. Using the critical screen I chose, I came up with
            a solution sketch that includes, on the left, the screen that comes before, and
            on the right, the screen that comes after.
            <br>
            <br>
            For the screen that comes before, I wanted the layout to be similar to the layout
            of most <strong>online shopping</strong> sites with filters on the side that the user can use to
            refine their search as they browse through the results.
            <br>
            <br>
            For the critical screen, I included a <strong>checklist</strong> of all the criteria that are met
            from the filter options the user selected, <strong>pictures</strong> of the dog that take up more
            than half the width of the screen because users mentioned that pictures are what
            grab their attention first, the dog's <strong>bio</strong> to provide more background and personality,
            <strong>shelter information</strong>, a <strong>question form</strong> that allows the user to ask the shelter more
            questions about the dog or adoption process if that information isn't clearly provided
            on the site, a <strong>"like" button</strong> that allows the user to save the dog's profile so they
            can come back to it later as they look at more potential dogs to adopt, and a <strong>"share"
            button</strong> if they feel like this dog could be the perfect dog for a friend of theirs to
            adopt.
            <br>
            <br>
            Lastly, the screen that comes after is what the user would see after they click the
            "adopt" button. Here they would be given very clear and straightforward <strong>instructions</strong>
            on what they need to do in order <strong>to adopt the dog</strong>.

          <p>
            Day 3 was for storyboarding! I drew some lofi sketches of each screen of the
            user flow from beginning to end starting from the home page to the adoption
            information page. The sequence goes from left to right, top to bottom. Each
            screen will be described in more detail in the next section when I
            present the prototype and high fidelity screens.

          <h1>Day 5: User Test</h1>
          <p>On the last day of the design sprint, I tested five people who would be interested in adopting a dog. The purpose of this usability test was to <strong>test the ease-of-use</strong> of the web app design and to see if the user is able to successfully complete the task of finding their “ideal dog” without frustration.</p>
          <h2>My Findings</h2>
          <h4>Issue #1</h4>
          <p>Issues with <strong>advanced search</strong> feature</p>
          <h4>Summary: </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Users not clear that clicking on this would provide more filters for them to choose from to further specify the type of dog they want to adopt</li>
            <li>Wording of “advanced search” does not match endearing wording of rest of web app</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Recommendations: </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Either list out all filters up front on home page</li>
            <li>Or reword “advanced search” so that it matches rest of web app and is clear that clicking on it would allow further refinement of search</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Issue #2</h4>
          <p><strong>Filter tab</strong> difficult to find</p>
          <h4>Summary: </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Some users found the filter tab difficult to locate on the screen due to the small text and the fact that the word was written sideways</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Recommendations: </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>May need to increase font size or make text horizontal instead of vertical</li>
            <li>Or do not make filter tab hideable (always visible) </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Issue #3</h4>
          <p>Adopt button and <strong>thank you page</strong></p>
          <h4>Summary: </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>After clicking adopt and brought to thank you page, seems like you’re done but there are still more steps to take to complete the adoption process</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Recommendations: </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Reword to “Next Steps”</li>
            <li>Have next steps listed as checklist on the side of the screen while the paperwork/links to other resources are embedded into main part of screen</li>
            <li>Have thank you/next steps pop up as modal instead of whole new screen</li>

          <h1>What I Learned</h1>
          <p>This was my first time running a <strong>design sprint</strong>, so I learned a lot about the <strong>process</strong> and what tasks should be completed by the end of each day. This project also really pushed me to <strong>think fast</strong> and <strong>design fast</strong>.
            Also, because I would already be conducting usability tests and getting feedback by the fifth day, I didn’t spend too much time second guessing my designs. I would soon know whether or not something works, and if something doesn’t work, I can start trying out a new solution.
