        At Seventh we are used AI and ML to help startup founders develop a high level IP strategy by curating
        personalized competitor insights, conducting prior art search, and providing an IP valuation estimate.
        This information helped them identify gaps and provide a better pitch to investors, show that they have
        done their due diligence, and have a better chance at receiving funding.

        <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
        Startups run into legal issues further down the road that can be extremely messy to resolve if they do
        not have their IP properly protected. Why?
        <br>
        As a startup founder, they have many other priorities that hold
        greater immediate importance than having their IP sorted out. The common culprits are:
        <ul>
          <li>not enough time/money</li>
          <li>legal things are confusing</li>
          <li>hiring a lawyer is expensive</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>How might we help founders do their due dilligence before it's too late?</strong>

      <div class="right" id="solution">
        <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
        "Turbo Tax for IP". Simplify the patent filing process and provide valuable insights about their market
        space so that they can focus on their company mission and make it a success.

    <h2>MY ROLE</h2>

    <div class="section">
      Working closely with the Head of Design and a Seventh Co-Founder, I focused on the high level IP strategy design
      for our founder user persona. Before beginning the design process, I conducted many user interviews and sent out
      surveys to get a better understanding of what startup founders struggle with, what they would like to see in our
      product, and at what stage we would be able to provide them with the most value. As a team, we also set up
      experiments to validate or invalidate hypotheses.
      <br>
      With this information, I designed high fidelity screens and conducted usability tests to see what people were
      most interested in and what kind of information they expected to find after clicking on certain elements.
      Designs were done in Sketch using the Material UI library. I wrote in-depth acceptance criteria so that design
      handoff to developers would be smooth. I also helped code some screens in React when our developers had other
      stories on their plates. Our primary focus was usability and functionality in order to have a working product
      by demo day.
