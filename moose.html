        <ul>

        MIT hosted a virtual hackathon inviting people from all over the world to take action on the
        COVID-19 crisis. There were 1500+ participants and 200+ teams. There were 10 different tracks
        we were randomly assigned to that targeted different problems that have come up due to COVID-19.
        My team placed top 4 within our track and was awarded $500 as well as resources and mentorship
        to further develop our idea!

        <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
        <p>
          Negative impact of social distancing and quarantines: There is an increase in feelings of loneliness
          and depression due to self-isolation and decline in economy. <strong>How might we improve people's mental
          well-being and quality of life while still maintaining physical distance from others to slow the spread
          of the coronavirus?</strong>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="right" id="solution">
        <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>A time-banked online skills exchange platform where people can meet virtually and teach
          each other things they are interested in.</strong> In this way, those that are isolated alone at home are still
          able to socialize, feel connected, and meet new people while also being productive with their time by
          learning something new. People who spend time teaching a skill can earn “time tokens” as a currency to
          purchase other skills. This incentivizes users to create a community where everyone contributes as well
          as consumes.

    <h2>CHALLENGES</h2>

    <div class="section">
      <div>
        <strong>Different time zones</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Everyone sacrificed sleep in order to spend as many waking
          hours working together as possible.</li>
          <li>I slept a total of about 6 hours that weekend!</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Communicating virtually</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>For brainstorming, we used <strong>Miro</strong> to replace physical sticky-notes.</li>
          <li>We used Google drive to organize documents and our pitch deck.</li>
          <li>I used <strong>Figma</strong> for design.</li>
          <li>We used Zoom and Slack for communication.</li>
          <ul style="padding-left:20px">
            <li>We jumped on Zoom calls to clarify the problem statement and
            solution idea, update what each person was working on and their progress,
            and address any roadblocks.</li>
            <li><strong>It was essentially like having weekly scrum meetings but compacted
            within 48 hours!</strong></li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

    <h2>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h2>

    <div class="section">
      <div>
        Since there are plenty of online educational and class-type platforms that
        already exist such as Skillshare, Coursera, and Udemy, we considered integrating
        our idea with an existing platform.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Pros</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Established user base</li>
          <li>Mature platform where people can share and learn through video</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Cons</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Teaching and learning largely one-sided because videos are prerecorded
          then uploaded</li>
          <ul style="padding-left:20px">
            <li>Lacks intimacy and not interactive</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Pay for classes with money</li>
          <ul style="padding-left:20px">
            <li>We wanted to introduce time-banking especially because money can be
            tight right now for a lot of people.</li>
            <li>Exchanging time spent teaching for "time tokens" that can be used to
            learn something encourages people to use the platform to not only learn
            from others but also teach a skill in order to foster an online community
            to combat feelings of loneliness when people are isolated.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        Because we wanted to maintain our unique business model of exchanging time for
        skills, we decided not to pursue integrating with existing platforms and decided
        to build our platform from scratch.
