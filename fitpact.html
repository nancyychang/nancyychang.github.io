        FitPact is a mobile app that takes advantage of human nature’s natural tendencies toward social interaction, competition, and rewards in order to
        encourage, motivate, and incentivize users to stay active one week at a time and maintain a healthy lifestyle. By gamifying exercise and connecting
        people with one another, people feel a greater sense of accountability and are more likely to accomplish their fitness goals.

    <h2>WHAT INSPIRED FITPACT?</h2>

    </div>

    <div id="stat">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="left">
          How many times have you heard someone say something along the lines of:<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <i><strong>“My New Year’s resolution is to start working out more!”</strong></i><br>
          <br>
          <i><strong>“Summer is coming in a few months. I’m going to start working out more to get that summer bod!”</strong></i><br>
          <br>
          <br>
          And how many times did you see those same people genuinely follow through with their promises to themselves?<br>
          <br>
          After sending out a screener survey to gauge how people feel about their level of fitness, I found that of the people who did not have a consistent exercise routine, 80% of them were not satisfied with their current level of fitness. The main thing that motivates people to exercise is “seeing results” with “competition” and “rewards” as close seconds.<br>
        </div>

        <div class="right">
          While I do agree that seeing results is the main thing that motivates me to exercise more, it took me over a year of consistently going to the gym before I saw any significant improvements to how fit I looked. Having a friend that went with me and kept me accountable made working out that much easier and enjoyable.<br>
          <br>
          A year is a long time to wait before seeing any results. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashiraprossack1/2018/12/31/goals-not-resolutions/#83d687e3879a" target="_blank">Many people give up on their New Year’s resolutions after only a month!</a> And what else is supposed to keep people motivated before they start seeing results?<br>
          <br>
          That is why I came up with FitPact, which targets “competition” and “rewards” as the main motivators by including the social aspect of creating pacts with friends and in-app messaging as well as being able to redeem tangible rewards using the fitness points you earn from successfully completing pacts.

        <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
        <p>
          Fitness apps have become increasingly popular among smartphone users, however, they <strong>lack</strong> an aspect of <strong>accountability</strong> that would help users to stay motivated to continue exercising consistently every week. FitPact is an app that takes advantage of human nature's natural tendencies toward <strong>social interaction</strong>, <strong>competition</strong>, and <strong>rewards</strong> in order to encourage, motivate, and incentivize users to stay active one week at a time and maintain a healthy lifestyle. My biggest design challenge was to structure fitness pacts in a way that was not too complicated but still fun to participate in.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="right" id="solution">
        <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
        <p>
          I conducted surveys and research to generate affinity and empathy maps and created personas in order to get some initial direction for the project. I then cycled through design and testing iterations to constantly receive feedback and iterate and improve on the app design.

        My role in this project was to organize all the data and feedback collected from <strong>research</strong> and <strong>testing</strong> to <strong>design</strong> an app that implemented the solution in a way that was engaging, intuitive, and fun for users to use.

    <h2>RESEARCH</h2>

    <div class="section-caption">
      <p>First, let's understand the user!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        After conducting some secondary research, I found that the problem a lot of people have is that they tend to make long-term big picture resolutions rather than actionable goals. While it’s good to know what you want as an end result, if you don’t see immediate results, it’s very easy to lose motivation. According to an article I read, more than 75% of people give up on their New Year’s resolutions within the first month!
        <br>
        <br>
        I also sent out a screener survey to determine what motivates people to exercise. “Seeing results” was stated as the main motivator with “competition” and “rewards” as close seconds. However, because seeing results takes time and consistent dedication, we run into the problem found from my secondary research where people lose motivation because they don’t see immediate results.
        <br>
        <br>
        So, I decided to focus on <strong>“competition”</strong> and <strong>“rewards”</strong> as the main motivators when brainstorming solutions to the problem.
        <br>
        <br>
        To determine possible user types, I conducted some interviews and organized my interview notes into affinity and empathy maps and then into personas.
        <br>
        <br>
        The <strong>affinity map</strong> was organized into <strong>7 different clusters: excuses, motivations, counting calories, schedule/routine, social/competition, time, and types of exercise.</strong>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="left">
        <img src="assets/img/fitpact_empathy1.jpg" class="empathy-responsive">
      </div>

      <div class="right">
        <img src="assets/img/fitpact_persona1.png" class="persona-responsive">
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="left">
        <p>
          The first user type is someone who <strong>rarely to never exercises</strong>. This user knows the benefits of exercise but somehow always comes up with an excuse not to.
          The barrier to entry seems to be that exercising looks difficult and intimidating, and when this user exerts more energy than usual, they notice physical pain or discomfort most likely due to infrequent exercise. Maybe having a companion to exercise with would make exercising less intimidating and more enjoyable.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          From this first user type, I created a persona I called “The Couch Potato”. “The Couch Potato” is <strong>lazy, evasive, and unmotivated</strong>, and generally prioritizes convenience, comfort, and enjoyment.
        </p>
      </div>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="left">
        <p>
          The second user type <strong>occasionally exercises</strong>. Without a set schedule, this user only exercises whenever it is convenient. Because they have a lot of other things going on in their lives, it would help if someone could help them set a schedule and send reminders. But once a goal is set, they will most likely meet it, and it helps when there are visual signs of progress.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          I call this persona “The Workaholic”. They are <strong>goal-oriented, busy, and reward-driven</strong> and prioritize convenience, time, and enjoyment.

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="left">
        <p>
          The third user type is someone who already <strong>regularly exercises</strong>. This user already has a consistent routine and is constantly comparing with themselves and others. This user has been consistently exercising for a while and has already achieved the reward of seeing results in their physical appearance and level of fitness and is motivated to do even better, for example, run a faster mile time, lift heavier weights, become more flexible, etc.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          This persona is called “The Fitness Buff”. They are <strong>disciplined, results-driven, and hardworking</strong>, and are mainly motivated by bettering their physical appearance and health as well as competition.

        The feedback I got for these initial designs were that there are <strong>too many features</strong>, which makes it feel very <strong>cluttered</strong>, which in turn makes it seem <strong>complicated and difficult to use</strong> causing a barrier to entry.
        <br>
        While the features included in my initial designs tried to address all the wants and needs of all three personas and encompassed everything I ever wanted in a fitness app, I had to remind myself that I am designing an intuitive solution for my target audience and not for myself.
        <br>
        <br>
        So I reworked the app so that it was simple and straightforward. It <strong>focused on one main feature which was creating weekly pacts with friends.</strong>

        <p>
          Since creating and participating in a pact was now the main feature, I created a user flow that mapped out the path a user would follow in order to complete this task.
          <br>
          Even though the app now only focused on pacts, it still targeted three of the original clusters from the affinity map: <strong>social/competition, schedule/routine, and motivations.</strong>

      <p><strong>Some self-critique:</strong> The top screen title header plus bottom navbar sandwiched the designs and made the available space for content and features very limited and felt <strong>squished</strong>.

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        In an effort to make the progress bar visual more satisfying to look at as each day of exercise was completed,
        I came up with three designs (arm wrestling, calendar, race) and surveyed a handful of people to see which one they liked the most.
        The arm wrestling design was the most popular, however, it posed the problem of not being all-inclusive because of the use
        of only two skin tones.

        So, I went back to the drawing board and came up with a new, more minimal design to <strong>match</strong> the <strong>aesthetic</strong> of
        the rest of the app using concentric circles that fills with color as each day of exercise is completed with each color
        representing the user and their friend. After receiving more feedback, I added in the checkmark to <strong>imitate</strong> a <strong>stamp card</strong> making it
        <strong>look and feel more complete.</strong>

        The icons in the navigation bar of the first couple of designs did <strong>not</strong> feel <strong>cohesive.</strong>
        Also, having the buttons for navigation at the top right of the screen took up to much space both vertically and horizontally.
        Having navigation at the top right also made it <strong>not easily accesible</strong> as this app is designed to be used on a mobile device.
        I eventually settled for a navigation bar placed at the bottom of the screen, which makes it easily accessible when using a
        mobile device with one hand, and the design is very <strong>rounded</strong> which matches the <strong>friendly and inviting</strong> theme of the overall design.

        The initial design did not include onboarding, and after conducting some user tests, I noticed that <strong>some people had to ask me
        to remind them how the pacts worked.</strong> I didn't want to attack users with a request to sign up when they first open the app. I
        wanted to first explain how everything works so users would feel more inclined to sign up afterwards.
        So I have onboarding at the beginning when a user opens the app for the first time, which gives a general overview of the benefits
        of using the app. Then, after signing up and setting the parameters of your first pact, there is a walkthrough of the different
        features on the pact screen, which you can exit out of and come back to at any time.

        I was initially worried about people gaming the system by creating an unlimited number of pacts and gaining a multiplied amount of fitness points by exercising the same amount they would have by only doing one pact. However, after receiving feedback from my usability tests, I realized that <strong>allowing multiple pacts is beneficial to the app because people would be excited to invite multiple friends to join them in pacts.</strong> A potential solution to moderate the business side of things is to limit the number of simultaneous pacts per person. In the future, I would need to conduct further tests to figure out a good balance between how many pacts a user would want to be in at the same time as well as how many pacts a user can be in at the same time without the business losing money by giving away too many fitness points, and therefore, too many free rewards.

        <li>While I read in multiple articles and books that we should <strong>test early and often</strong>,

        <li>Constantly gaining feedback, both good and bad, really
          helped me determine what direction to go in when I felt stumped or lacked inspiration.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't get too attached to your very first design!</strong> Chances are, that's not your best work.
          Coming up with many different variations will help you think outside the box and come up with
          something unique, and again, you can test the different versions to see which one is best!</li>
        <li>It could help to <strong>narrow the scope of the project</strong> so that it really focuses on one main feature
          rather than a bunch, which made the app easier and more straightforward to use.</li>
