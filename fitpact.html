        <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <p>
          How many times have you heard someone say something along the lines of:<br>
          <br>
          <i>“My New Year’s resolution is to start working out more!”</i><br>
          <i>“Summer is coming in a few months. I’m going to start working out more to get that summer bod!”</i><br>
          <br>
          And how many times did you see those same people genuinely follow through with their promises to themselves?<br>
          <br>
          After sending out a screener survey to gauge how people feel about their level of fitness, I found that many people who did not have a consistent exercise routine were not satisfied with their current level of fitness. The main thing that motivates people to exercise is “seeing results” with “competition” and “rewards” as close seconds.<br>
          <br>
          While I do agree that seeing results is the main thing that motivates me to exercise more, it took me over a year of consistently going to the gym before I saw any significant improvements to how fit I looked. Having a friend that went with me and kept me accountable made working out that much easier and enjoyable.<br>
          <br>
          A year is a long time to wait before seeing any results. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashiraprossack1/2018/12/31/goals-not-resolutions/#83d687e3879a" target="_blank">Many people give up on their New Year’s resolutions after only a month!</a> And what else is supposed to keep people motivated before they start seeing results?<br>
          <br>
          That is why I came up with FitPact, which targets “competition” and “rewards” as the main motivators by including the social aspect of creating pacts with friends and in-app messaging as well as being able to redeem tangible rewards using the fitness points you earn from successfully completing pacts.

        <h1>PROBLEM</h1>
        <p>
          Fitness apps have become increasingly popular among smartphone users, however, they lack an aspect of accountability that would help users to stay motivated to continue exercising consistently every week. FitPact is an app that takes advantage of human nature’s natural tendencies toward social interaction, competition, and rewards in order to encourage, motivate, and incentivize users to stay active one week at a time and maintain a healthy lifestyle. My biggest design challenge was to structure fitness pacts in a way that was not too complicated but still fun to participate in.

        <h1>SOLUTION</h1>
        <p>
          I conducted surveys and research to generate affinity and empathy maps and created personas in order to get some initial direction for the project. I then cycled through design and testing iterations to constantly receive feedback and iterate and improve on the app design.

        <p>
          My role in this project was to organize all the data and feedback collected from research and testing to design an app that implemented the solution in a way that was engaging, intuitive, and fun for users to use.
