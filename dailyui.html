    <h2>DAILY UI #1 - SIGN UP</h2>

    <div class="section">
      <img src="assets/img/dailyui/dailyui1.gif" class="ui" width="700">
      <p>
        Made a sign up page for a completely made up weekly donut recipe newsletter because I was craving donuts.

    <h2>DAILY UI #2 - CREDIT CARD CHECKOUT</h2>

    <div class="section">
      <video controls autoplay class="ui" width="300">
        <source src="assets/img/dailyui/dailyui2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video>
      <p>
        I'm not sure why the transitions are wonky. I will try to fix it when I have time. The idea was to have an
        actual image of a credit card while you’re filling out the payment information so the user has a more direct
        mental model (I remember I used to be confused where to find the CVV and what it even was so this would have
        helped without needing to click on an additional help/more info icon). After looking on Dribbble though, turns
        out this idea actually isn’t that unique, but it's okay. Here is my version. Also the “success” screen at the
        end is super ugly. Also something I will try to fix in the next iteration.

    <h2>DAILY UI #3 - LANDING PAGE</h2>

    <div class="section">
      <img src="assets/img/dailyui/dailyui3.png" class="ui" width="700">
      <p>
        The third prompt was for a landing page for literally anything, and I had to come up with something myself. The
        first thing that came to mind were Heelys so I just ran with it LOL. I apologize for the tackiness.
