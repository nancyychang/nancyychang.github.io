    <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="left">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Tools: </strong>Sketch, Adobe Illustrator, InVision Studio</li>
          <li><strong>Deliverables: </strong>UI/UX, Wireframing, Prototyping, User Testing</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="right">
        After my initial interview with Arm Treasure Data, I was given a take-home design exercise
        to complete and present during the next video call. The assignment was to design a personal
        job tracker with me, the job seeker, as the primary user.
        <br>
        <br>
        The use cases I had to include were:
        <ol>
          <li>Add a note for the company or person you are interviewing with</li>
          <li>Change status of application and view timeline</li>
          <li>Read and reply to email threads without going to Gmail</li>
          <li>Edit profile of interviewer</li>
          <li>Put in a task (like a design exercise or thank you followup email)</li>
          <li>View details of design exercise</li>
          <li>See how long commute would be</li>
          <li>Rate company for different personal criteria</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>PROTOTYPE</h2>

      Here is a video of the prototype I created on InVision Studio:

      Unfortunately, I did not proceed to the next round of interviews, but I had a lot of fun
      working on this take-home design exercise, and I received some helpful feedback.

    <h2>HIGH FIDELITY MOCKUPS & FEEDBACK</h2>

    <div class="section">
      <p><strong>Left Side Nav:</strong>
        <br>
        I designed icons for the dashboard, application history, recruiters, and active jobs.
        We will only be looking at screens under active jobs.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Right Side Nav:</strong>
        <br>
        I wanted to make this similar to the extensions I see in Gmail because this is something
        I am already familiar with. The idea of the calendar is that I can click on it to view what
        my interview schedule looks like in the upcoming weeks/months. The teal star with a plus
        sign allows me to add my different personal rating criteria. I can view the notes I took
        specific to the tab I'm on by clicking on the notes icon (use case 1). And finally, I can
        modify features in settings to customize my personal job tracker.

          The overview screen shows me the company's name, the position I applied for, a rating out of five stars,
          how long the commute is, application status (use case 2), timeline of interviews and assignments (use case 2),
          and my email thread with the recruiter/interviewer (use case 3).

          It should still include text modification features such as changing fonts, font size,
          bolding, italicizing, etc and be able to attach files.

          A modal with a form pops up when I click on the edit button. Here I can input the
          company's address, company's website, and a link to the job post which will be embedded
          in the page after I click the save button.

          <strong>Feedback:</strong>
          <br>
          Pop up modals are outdated and clunky because it requires the
          user to go through multiple steps in order to update/edit information. It would be more
          modern to just make it similar to how Google docs are where I can edit and autosave in
          real time.

          Elements on the screen are shifted to the left when I open up my notes. Here I
          can add notes about the company such as company size, mission, perks, etc.

          I originally only had the info of one interviewer on this screen, but I realized that
          further along in the interview process I may have more than one interviewer, so I added
          the ability to toggle between different interviewers. (use case 4)

          These are my personal rating criteria. I can adjust the rating by dragging the knob along
          the slider (use case 8). I made the slider go from 1 to 10 to allow for half stars. (The
          overview page shows the overall rating out of five stars).

          Deleting a rating criteria on a specific job's rating page would delete it on all the rating tabs
          of each active job, so a modal would pop up to confirm that I really want to delete it.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Feedback:</strong>
          <br>
          It's too easy to perform this delete action which will delete the criteria
          across all active jobs. This delete action would be better suited maybe in the settings.

          If I want to add more personal rating criteria, I can click on the star icon on the right nav,
          and this will add that rating criteria to all active jobs.

          I just made the tasks look like a simple to-do list with checkboxes next to each task which
          I can check off as I complete each task. I originally wanted the task to be crossed out once
          the checkbox is checked, but I decided I still wanted to be able to read what the completed
          task was.

    <h2>OVERALL FEEDBACK</h2>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Could use improvement on visual design or make use of UI kits. Be more consistent about button
        placement. Design techniques also need improvement. I started doing <a href="https://www.dailyui.co/" target="_blank">Daily UI Challenges</a>
        in order to get more practice with visual design and hopefully improve my design technique as well.
        Check out my <a href="dailyui.html">"Daily UI" tab</a> to see my progress on that!
