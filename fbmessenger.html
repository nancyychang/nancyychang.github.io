      <h2>USER RESEARCH</h2>
      <p>
        In order to start tackling the prompt of improving Facebook messenger,
        I took to Instagram stories to ask a question to my followers (I made
        the assumption that users of Instagram most likely also used Facebook
        messenger):
      </p>
      <div id="igstoryq">
        <img src="assets/img/igstoryq.jpeg" alt="Instagram Story Question" class="igstoryq-responsive">
      </div>
      <p>
        After receiving responses for this question, I realized that the responses
        I received were more user-proposed solutions rather than the raw description
        of the problems they were encountering.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pinned messages</li>
        <li>Customized reactions</li>
        <li>Threads</li>
        <li>Shortcuts</li>
        <li>Better searchability</li>
        <li>Tiered chats</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Looking back, I should have phrased my question better by asking what
        problems people faced when using Facebook messenger rather than what they
        would improve. So, I backtracked and asked the people who responded what
        problem they were thinking of when they proposed their solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The problem that most people described no matter what solution they proposed
        was that it is hard to find a message they want to view again if many messages
        have been sent after it.</strong> They would either have to scroll for a long time or
        search many potential keywords and click through the search results to see
        if they find what they're looking for. Many referenced Slack's ability to
        pin messages. (The context in which Slack is used, though, is usually for
        work or for a large organization, so I wanted to somehow incorporate a version
        of pinned messages on Facebook messenger without taking away from the casual
        feel of chatting with friends.)

      <h2>PEOPLE PROBLEM</h2>
      <p>
        Here is the problem stated again in the people problem format.
        <br>
        When someone sends a message with important information, I want to be able
        to easily find it again later, so I can remind myself of what it said.
        But I can’t because:
        <ol>
          <li>I might have to scroll very far back, which would take a long time,
            and I might miss it while skimming.</li>
          <li>I don't remember what the message said, so I don't know what keywords to search.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>
        Pain Points:
        <ul>
          <li>It is easy for messages to get lost when people are sending a lot
            of messages in the chat</li>
          <li>An inconvenient and indirect workaround is needed if you want to
            make sure you remember a message that was sent</li>
          <li>There is no one straightforward solution to save a message</li>
          <li>Scrolling can take a long time and is annoying</li>
          <li>Using the “search conversation” feature could require a lot of
            guessing if you don’t remember what was said in the message (which
            you probably don’t; that’s why you’re looking for it)</li>
          <li>Because they can’t find the message they’re looking for, people may
            ask the same questions over and over again</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
      <p>
        After talking to people who responded to my Instagram story question, I
        found that many of them were very enthusiastic about improving the ability
        to search and find messages in a chat. They were pretty satisfied with
        the rest of messenger, and the problem of not being able to easily find
        a message isn’t so bad that it made them stop using messenger altogether,
        but it would definitely be a big nice-to-have. Many people applauded how
        Slack is designed and how you’re able to pin messages in Slack, and they
        had many examples of when it would have been nice to be able to pin a
        message while they were using messenger:
        <ul>
          <li>Someone's address</li>
          <li>Meeting time and location</li>
          <li>Login credentials of a shared streaming service</li>
          <li>Links to spreadsheets and documents related to travel planning</li>
          <li>Announcements if using group chat for a team</li>
          <li>Information that could help for an assignement for a class they are all in</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>IDEATION</h2>
      <p>
        Pinning a message seemed to be the most logical way to save a message to
        view again later, so I brainstormed some ideas for how this feature could
        be implemented.
      </p>
      <div id="ideation-img">
        <img src="assets/img/ideation.jpeg" alt="Brainstorming Ideas With Post-It Notes" class="ideation-responsive">
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>Pinned messages would stay persistent at the top of the chat and always
          visible kind of like how a reminder will stay at the top of the chat until
          it is over or deleted (this idea was eventually discarded because if there
          are more than one pinned message, the top of the chat could become cluttered
          and cover the contents of the actual chat)</li>
        <li>Pinned messages can be saved and found in a separate tab under the
          settings/more info section of a chat</li>
        <li>Clicking on a pinned message would bring you to the point in the conversation
          when the message was sent so you can gain more context about the message</li>
        <li>All members of the chat can view pinned messages and who pinned them
          but only the person who pinned a message should be able to unpin it</li>
      </ul>

          all pinned messages → 6. Click on pin emoji button to unpin a message
          when it's not needed anymore → 7. Click unpin in the popup modal to confirm
           → 8. Message shows that it's not pinned anymore

      <p>
        My solution tries to incorporate Facebook messenger’s current UI so that
        it doesn’t feel unfamiliar to the user. The example I show in the user
        flow above is of a group chat where the members are deciding on a time
        and place to meet and work on a project because that was the example
        brought up the most while I was interviewing users. In order to pin a
        message, you would have to long press on the message the same way you
        would if you want to react to it. A pin emoji would show up as a button
        next to the reaction emojis and reply button. You would then click on the
        name of the group chat to find a tab named “Pinned Messages” under “Options”.
        Here you would be able to see all pinned messages in the chat or switch
        to the “pinned by you” tab to only see messages pinned by you. Before you
        can unpin a message, a popup modal would ask you to confirm similar to
        when you try to leave a chat. I feel like this new pin feature wouldn’t
        be hard to find because people already know how to react to messages, and
        they would discover it the next time they try to do that. Long pressing
        a message in order to pin it is also how it is done in Slack, and since
        many people who suggested pinning also mentioned Slack, this would be a
        very familiar interaction. If Facebook ever adds this feature to messenger,
        I believe it would be very positively received, but of course, my next
        steps would be to test my prototype in order to confirm any assumptions I made.
        <br>
        Below is a video of a rough prototype of how the pinning feature would work:
