    <h2>SUMMARY</h2>

    <div class="section">
        Much of the Fortellis Marketplace was developed with little to no UX input. The platform is wrought with usability issues. With the
        company's goal to modernize our products and switch over to a new design system, we are given the opportunity to re-evaluate the
        entire platform and address the lingering design tech debt. I worked on a team of 9 as a UX Designer I. The main areas I touched on were
        app product detail pages, app creation workflow, subscription workflow, and navigation.

    <h2>MY ROLE</h2>

    <div class="section">
      As a UX Designer on the Fortellis team, I conducted market research and user interviews, reorganized the information architecture, cleaned
      up various user workflows throughout the platform, wireframed in Miro, produced high fidelity screens in Sketch, handed off designs in
      InVision, created clickable prototypes, and conducted usability tests. I also volunteered to do work not formally included in the role
      description such as creating working processes with new stakeholders (product & engineering) and meticulous documentation in order to later
      do fine tuning.
